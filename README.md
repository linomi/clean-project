# mouse_visual_cortex_NN_modeling
## here is project to model mouse visual cortex using transformer architechture 
generaly this task named ENcoding . im trying to predict mouse visual cortex responses to visual stimuli

thre are a few moduls 
* filter module that filters cells with high reliablity responses ( generally speaking its easier to predict more reliable neurons)
* load data module that loading data from allenbrain observatory dataset (ophys dataset)
* build model that takes hyperparameters and then build desire tranformer model
